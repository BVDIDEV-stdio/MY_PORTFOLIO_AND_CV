## Work Experiencs
### HSE University (NN Campus):** Unity Programming Tutor: 2024-2025 

In the first semester of 2024-2025 academic year I taught practical classes for students (Faculty of Informatics, Mathematics and Computer Science). My responsibilities included:
- Syllabus Development
- Leading Practical Sessions
- Designing Lab Assignments Guidelines
- Lab Assignment Review and Grading (grades are recorded in students' project issues; you can access them via my contributions and activity log)\
In the second semester I advised students working on Unity projects as part of their term paper.

## ПPortfolio
### Thesis Paper and Graduation Project
As my graduation project I developed Unity game prototype to showcase the skills I acquired over four years of study. The prototype features a scene that includes:
- **Player character** capable of running, jumping, attacking and performing combo attacks, as well as shooting a projectile as a secondary attack;
- **Enemy character** that can patrol its surroundings or rapidly approach the player to attack; (enemy behaviour reminds that of Holow Knight basic enemies)
- healing mechanics and healing items logic
The project was designed with a focus to minimize component dependencies, ensuring modularity and scalability. The approach allows for easy improvements and reworking certain mechanics without overhauling the entire game code.

### Test Assignment : (b)race yourself
A mini-project I made as an assignment from a potential (not anymore) employer. So it ends up in my portfolio, why not.

**Gameplay**
- First run: the player casually drives through the route. Their movements are real-time recorded during this run.\
![Bruh gif gone](/gif1.gif)
- Second run: the player competes a "ghost" car that replays the exact movements from their first run, allowing them to race against their own previous performance. \
![Bruh and this one gone too](/gif.gif)

**Features**
- *Input Recording* is as precise as Rigidbody (and I guess physics engine) calculations are. Input record is called in Update exactly because it records a rigidbody-using "pawn" (car);
- *Input Replay* simply passes input commands into controller - like if player would do. This was made possible thanks to IInputReader (called somewhat else can't recall (pun not intended)) that both *player input class* and *input  replay class* derive from. Of course had to tweak SimCadeVehicleController a little to support input-transmitting classes, as well as new InputSystem;
- CineMachine camera transitions




### Pet project
https://github.com/BVDIDEV-stdio/ITSADAMNJOKE-repo
So far the project (prototype stage) includes:
- WASD movement
- **Jumping**: can provide a regular jumping as well as double-jumping via maxAirJumps that can be increased (e. g. by getting an ability item)
- **Dash**: DOOM Eternal style: quickly dodge attacks and access hard-to-reach areas. Player's gravity is set to 0 while dashing to provide easy platforming. Dodges do exhaust and recharge so the player can not spam this ability. Max consecutive dodges quantity is adjustable, too
- **Inventory and Item**: in-game **Item** class entities store refs to Scriptable Objects defining items' very basic properties: title, description, weight and so on. Items are pickable via raycast from player's Camera.transform.forward. **Inventory** class works with a list of **ItemParams** objects carrying the exact values of **Item**s picked in the world (thus destroyed). Inventory has its standard item list logic implemented (addition/removal) as well as UnityEvents, which on invokation call various methods (e. g. Inventory UI update).
//Also inventory component is designed to be "written once, attached everywhere" so both Player and non-playable entities could use its functions.
- **UI:** The project includes a **UIWindow** class that serves as a base for any window-based UI. It is user-adjustable in "TES3 Morrowind"-way: players can drag its edges and the upper right corner to resize and reposition the window as needed. **UIWindow** contains no additional logic and acts solely as a content platform - each content element should implement its own logic. For example, the **InventoryMenu** class uses **UIWindow** methods to display buttons and a scrollbar yet the logic for these controls is handled entirely within InventoryMenu.

Additionally, the project features a placeholder pause menu implemented using a menu stack approach.

- **UI: HUD for item info**: this HUD piece displays a card containing the briefest item info (name, pic, type in rarity color style). While the card is displayed, the item is indicated by a rectangular frame that fits the pixel boundaries of the item mesh.
**WIP: Weapon class : Item, EquipSystem and Projectiles**: currently I am working on weapons Raycast/projectile spawn and also have got working EquipSystem allowing to equip weapons in either hand as well as to wield a weapon in both hands by "switching the grip mode". My goal was to implement the equip system similar to those found in Soulsborne games, because:
  1. This is an ***utterly*** entertaining challenge
  2. With careful game design and weapon balancing (including grip variations, bonuses, and penalties) this system will provide a solid foundation for players to experiment with different builds.
  3. I feel eager to **experiment firsthand** to discover the potential of this kind of system in *first-person shooters*.
